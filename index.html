            <h3>Here's a timeline of John Entwistle's life:</h3>

                    <strong>1959</strong> - John forms The Confederates with Pete Townshend at Acton County School. John
                    plays the French horn and Pete plays the banjo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1961</strong> - John joins The Detours after being recruited by Roger Daltrey. John plays
                    bass guitar.
                </li>

                    <strong>1962</strong> - John suggests Pete Townshend join the Detours, and Pete joins the band.
                </li>

                    <strong>1964</strong> - The Detours change their name to The Who, with Keith Moon joining on drums.
                    The band is briefly marketed as The High Numbers before reverting to The Who.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1965</strong> - The Who release their first single, "I Can't Explain." Later that year, they
